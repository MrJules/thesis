\section{imageCLEF challenge}

ImageCLEF launched in 2013 and was proposed by Mark Sanderson and Paul Clough from the Department of Information Studies from the University of Sheffield, with the goal of providing support for the evaluation of 1) language-independent methods for the automatic annotation of images with concepts, 2) multimodal information retrieval methods based on the combination of visual and textual features, and 3) multilingual image retrieval methods, so as to compare the effect of retrieval of image annotations and query formulations in several languages.

Currently, ImageCLEF main goal is to support the advancement of the field of visual media analysis, indexing, classification, and retrieval, by developing the necessary infrastructure for the evaluation of visual information retrieval systems operating in both monolingual, crossâ€“language and language-independent contexts. ImageCLEF aims at providing reusable resources for such benchmarking purposes.
